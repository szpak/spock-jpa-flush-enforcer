# spock-jpa-flush-enforcer

PoC for BlockListener support (PR [#1575](https://github.com/spockframework/spock/pull/1575)). Under heavily development.

**IMPORTANT**. This version uses the snapshot version of Spock 2.4 taken from commit [5a2f3f2cda43a229cd98dde4f2f41e4ade9bfb89](https://github.com/spockframework/spock/commit/5a2f3f2cda43a229cd98dde4f2f41e4ade9bfb89). The Spock version named `2.4-M4-flush2-groovy-4.0-SNAPSHOT` should be built and installed locally.
